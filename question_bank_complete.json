      "model_answer": "“The 3 major financial statements are the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement. The Income Statement gives the company’s revenue and expenses, and goes down to Net Income, the final line on the statement. The Balance Sheet shows the company’s Assets – its resources – such as Cash, Inventory and PP&E, as well as its Liabilities – such as Debt and Accounts Payable – and Shareholders’ Equity. Assets must equal Liabilities plus Shareholders’ Equity. The Cash Flow Statement begins with Net Income, adjusts for non-cash expenses and working capital changes, and then lists cash flow from investing and financing activities; at the end, you see the company’s net change in cash.”",

      "model_answer": "“To tie the statements together, Net Income from the Income Statement flows into Shareholders’ Equity on the Balance Sheet, and into the top line of the Cash Flow Statement. Changes to Balance Sheet items appear as working capital changes on the Cash Flow Statement, and investing and financing activities affect Balance Sheet items such as PP&E, Debt and Shareholders’ Equity. The Cash and Shareholders’ Equity items on the Balance Sheet act as “plugs,” with Cash flowing in from the final line on the Cash Flow Statement.”",

      "model_answer": "You would use the Cash Flow Statement because it gives a true picture of how much cash the company is actually generating, independent of all the non-cash expenses you might have. And that’s the #1 thing you care about when analyzing the overall financial health of any business – its cash flow.",

      "model_answer": "Income Statement: Operating Income would decline by $10 and assuming a 40% tax rate, Net Income would go down by $6. Cash Flow Statement: The Net Income at the top goes down by $6, but the $10 Depreciation is a non-cash expense that gets added back, so overall Cash Flow from Operations goes up by $4. There are no changes elsewhere, so the overall Net Change in Cash goes up by $4. Balance Sheet: Plants, Property & Equipment goes down by $10 on the Assets side because of the Depreciation, and Cash is up by $4 from the changes on the Cash Flow Statement. Overall, Assets is down by $6. Since Net Income fell by $6 as well, Shareholders’ Equity on the Liabilities & Shareholders’ Equity side is down by $6 and both sides of the Balance Sheet balance. Note: With this type of question I always recommend going in the order:",

      "model_answer": "For this question, confirm that the accrued compensation is now being recognized as an expense (as opposed to just changing non-accrued to accrued compensation). Assuming that’s the case, Operating Expenses on the Income Statement go up by $10, Pre-Tax Income falls by $10, and Net Income falls by $6 (assuming a 40% tax rate). On the Cash Flow Statement, Net Income is down by $6, and Accrued Compensation will increase Cash Flow by $10, so overall Cash Flow from Operations is up by $4 and the Net Change in Cash at the bottom is up by $4. On the Balance Sheet, Cash is up by $4 as a result, so Assets are up by $4. On the Liabilities & Equity side, Accrued Compensation is a liability so Liabilities are up by $10 and Retained Earnings are down by $6 due to the Net Income, so both sides balance.",

      "question": "What happens when Inventory goes up by $10, assuming you pay for it with cash? No changes to the Income Statement.",
      "model_answer": "On the Cash Flow Statement, Inventory is an asset so that decreases your Cash Flow from Operations – it goes down by $10, as does the Net Change in Cash at the bottom. On the Balance Sheet under Assets, Inventory is up by $10 but Cash is down by $10, so the changes cancel out and Assets still equals Liabilities & Shareholders’ Equity.",

      "question": "Why is the Income Statement not affected by changes in Inventory?",
      "model_answer": "This is a common interview mistake – incorrectly stating that Working Capital changes show up on the Income Statement. In the case of Inventory, the expense is only recorded when the goods associated with it are sold – so if it’s just sitting in a warehouse, it does not count as a Cost of Good Sold or Operating Expense until the company manufactures it into a product and sells it.",

      "question": "Let’s say Apple is buying $100 worth of new iPod factories with debt. How are all 3 statements affected at the start of “Year 1,” before anything else happens? At the start of “Year 1,” before anything else has happened, there would be no changes on Apple’s Income Statement (yet).",
      "model_answer": "On the Cash Flow Statement, the additional investment in factories would show up under Cash Flow from Investing as a net reduction in Cash Flow (so Cash Flow is down by $100 so far). And the additional $100 worth of debt raised would show up as an addition to Cash Flow, canceling out the investment activity. So the cash number stays the same. On the Balance Sheet, there is now an additional $100 worth of factories in the Plants, Property & Equipment line, so PP&E is up by $100 and Assets is therefore up by $100. On the other side, debt is up by $100 as well and so both sides balance.",

      "question": "Now let’s go out 1 year, to the start of Year 2. Assume the debt is high-yield so no principal is paid off, and assume an interest rate of 10%. Also assume the factories depreciate at a rate of 10% per year. What happens?",
      "model_answer": "After a year has passed, Apple must pay interest expense and must record the depreciation. Operating Income would decrease by $10 due to the 10% depreciation charge each year, and the $10 in additional Interest Expense would decrease the Pre-Tax Income by $20 altogether ($10 from the depreciation and $10 from Interest Expense). Assuming a tax rate of 40%, Net Income would fall by $12. On the Cash Flow Statement, Net Income at the top is down by $12. Depreciation is a non-cash expense, so you add it back and the end result is that Cash Flow from Operations is down by $2. That’s the only change on the Cash Flow Statement, so overall Cash is down by $2. On the Balance Sheet, under Assets, Cash is down by $2 and PP&E is down by $10 due to the depreciation, so overall Assets are down by $12. On the other side, since Net Income was down by $12, Shareholders’ Equity is also down by $12 and both sides balance. Remember, the debt number under Liabilities does not change since we’ve assumed none of the debt is actually paid back.",

      "model_answer": "After 2 years, the value of the factories is now $80 if we go with the 10% depreciation per year assumption. It is this $80 that we will write down in the 3 statements. First, on the Income Statement, the $80 write-down shows up in the Pre-Tax Income line. With a 40% tax rate, Net Income declines by $48. On the Cash Flow Statement, Net Income is down by $48 but the write-down is a non- cash expense, so we add it back – and therefore Cash Flow from Operations increases by $32. There are no changes under Cash Flow from Investing, but under Cash Flow from Financing there is a $100 charge for the loan payback – so Cash Flow from Investing falls by $100. Overall, the Net Change in Cash falls by $68. On the Balance Sheet, Cash is now down by $68 and PP&E is down by $80, so Assets have decreased by $148 altogether. On the other side, Debt is down $100 since it was paid off, and since Net Income was down by $48, Shareholders’ Equity is down by $48 as well. Altogether, Liabilities & Shareholders’ Equity are down by $148 and both sides balance.",

      "model_answer": "No changes to the Income Statement. Cash Flow Statement – Inventory is up by $10, so Cash Flow from Operations decreases by $10. There are no further changes, so overall Cash is down by $10. On the Balance Sheet, Inventory is up by $10 and Cash is down by $10 so the Assets number stays the same and the Balance Sheet remains in balance.",

      "model_answer": "Income Statement: Revenue is up by $20 and COGS is up by $10, so Gross Profit is up by $10 and Operating Income is up by $10 as well. Assuming a 40% tax rate, Net Income is up by $6. Cash Flow Statement: Net Income at the top is up by $6 and Inventory has decreased by $10 (since we just manufactured the inventory into real iPods), which is a net addition to cash flow – so Cash Flow from Operations is up by $16 overall. These are the only changes on the Cash Flow Statement, so Net Change in Cash is up by $16. On the Balance Sheet, Cash is up by $16 and Inventory is down by $10, so Assets is up by $6 overall.

On the Cash Flow Statement, Net Income is down by $60 but the write-down is a non- cash expense, so we add it back – and therefore Cash Flow from Operations increases by $40. Overall, the Net Change in Cash rises by $40. On the Balance Sheet, Cash is now up by $40 and an asset is down by $100 (it’s not clear which asset since the question never stated the specific asset to write-down).

The most common scenario here is an equity investment from the government, so here’s what happens: No changes to the Income Statement. On the Cash Flow Statement, Cash Flow from Financing goes up by $100 to reflect the government’s investment, so the Net Change in Cash is up by $100.

      "model_answer": "This is counter-intuitive. When a liability is written down you record it as a gain on the Income Statement (with an asset write-down, it’s a loss) – so Pre-Tax Income goes up by $100 due to this write-down. Assuming a 40% tax rate, Net Income is up by $60. On the Cash Flow Statement, Net Income is up by $60, but we need to subtract that debt write-down – so Cash Flow from Operations is down by $40, and Net Change in Cash is down by $40. On the Balance Sheet, Cash is down by $40 so Assets are down by $40. On the other side, Debt is down by $100 but Shareholders’ Equity is up by $60 because the Net Income was up by $60 – so Liabilities & Shareholders’ Equity is down by $40 and it balances.

To calculate the dilutive effect of the options, first you note that the options are all “in-the-money” – their exercise price is less than the current share price. When these options are exercised, there will be 10 new shares created – so the share count is now 110 rather than 100. However, that doesn’t tell the whole story. In order to exercise the options, we had to “pay” the company $5 for each option (the exercise price). As a result, it now has $50 in additional cash, which it now uses to buy back 5 of the new shares we created. So the fully diluted share count is 105, and the fully diluted equity value is $1,050.",

      "model_answer": "This gets confusing because of the different units involved. First, note that these convertible bonds are in-the-money because the company’s share price is $100, but the conversion price is $50. So we count them as additional shares rather than debt. Next, we need to divide the value of the convertible bonds – $10 million – by the par value – $1,000 – to figure out how many individual bonds we get: $10 million / $1,000 = 10,000 convertible bonds. Next, we need to figure out how many shares this number represents. The number of shares per bond is the par value divided by the conversion price: $1,000 / $50 = 20 shares per bond. So we have 200,000 new shares (20 * 10,000) created by the convertibles, giving us 1.2 million diluted shares outstanding. We do not use the Treasury Stock Method with convertibles because the company is not “receiving” any cash from us.",

      "model_answer": "This is tricky – the one without debt will have a higher WACC up to a certain point, because debt is “less expensive” than equity. Why? • Interest on debt is tax-deductible (hence the (1 – Tax Rate) multiplication in the WACC formula). • Debt is senior to equity in a company’s capital structure – debt holders would be paid first in a liquidation or bankruptcy. • Intuitively, interest rates on debt are usually lower than the Cost of Equity numbers you see (usually over 10%). As a result, the Cost of Debt portion of WACC will contribute less to the total figure than the Cost of Equity portion will. However, the above is true only to a certain point. Once a company’s debt goes up high enough, the interest rate will rise dramatically to reflect the additional risk and so the Cost of Debt would start to increase – if it gets high enough, it might become higher than Cost of Equity and additional debt would increase WACC. It’s a “U-shape” curve where debt decreases WACC to a point, then starts increasing it.",

The Enterprise Value, in turn, would fall by the present value of that $100 decrease in Free Cash Flow. The actual math here is messy but you would calculate the present value by dividing $100 by ((1 + Discount Rate)^4) – the “4” just represents year 4 here.

Next, you determine the valuations and shares outstanding of the buyer and seller and project out an Income Statement for each one. Finally, you combine the Income Statements, adding up line items such as Revenue and Operating Expenses, and adjusting for Foregone Interest on Cash and Interest Paid on Debt in the Combined Pre-Tax Income line; you apply the buyer’s Tax Rate to get the Combined Net Income, and then divide by the new share count to determine the combined EPS.”",

Let’s say this RPS is $0.10 right now. If Microsoft acquired it, we might assume that they could boost this RPS by $0.01 or $0.02 because of their superior monetization. So to calculate the additional revenue from this synergy, we would multiply this $0.01 or $0.02 by Yahoo’s total # of searches, get the total additional revenue, and then select a margin on it to determine how much flows through to the combined company’s Operating Income.”",

In addition, the seller has total assets of $200 million, total liabilities of $150 million, and shareholders’ equity of $50 million. Here’s what would happen to the combined company’s balance sheet (ignoring transaction/financing fees): • First, you simply add the seller’s Assets and Liabilities (but NOT Shareholders’ Equity – it is wiped out) to the buyer’s to get your “initial” balance sheet. Assets are up by $200 million and Liabilities are down by $150 million. • Then, Cash on the Assets side goes down by $500 million. • Debt on the Liabilities & Equity side goes up by $500 million. • You get a new Deferred Tax Liability of $40 million ($100 million * 40%) on the Liabilities & Equity side. • Assets are down by $300 million total and Liabilities & Shareholders’ Equity are up by $690 million ($500 + $40 + $150). • So you need Goodwill & Intangibles of $990 million on the Assets side to make both sides balance.",

Even though the seller still gets taxed twice, buyers will often pay more in a 338(h)(10) deal because of the tax-savings potential. It’s particularly helpful for: • Sellers with high NOL balances (more tax-savings for the buyer because this NOL balance will be written down completely – and so more of the excess purchase price can be allocated to asset write-ups). • If the company has been an S-corporation for over 10 years – in this case it doesn’t have to pay a tax on the appreciation of its assets.

Normally you would determine how much stock to issue by dividing the $100 million by the buyer’s stock price, and using that to get the new share count.

The main difference is that incurrence covenants prevent you from doing something (such as selling an asset, buying a factory, etc.) while maintenance covenants require you to maintain a minimum financial performance (for example, the Debt/EBITDA ratio must be below 5x at all times). • Bank debt is usually amortized – the principal must be paid off over time – whereas with high-yield debt, the entire principal is due at the end (bullet maturity).

Note, however, that their cash flow is still lower than it would be without the debt – saving on taxes helps, but the added interest expenses still reduces Net Income over what it would be for a debt-free company.",

The difference is that there’s no technical limit on how much management might receive from such an option pool: if they hit it out of the park, maybe they’ll all become millionaires. In your LBO model, you would need to calculate a per-share purchase price when the PE firm exits the investment, and then calculate how much of the proceeds go to the management team based on the Treasury Stock Method. An option pool by itself would reduce the PE firm’s return, but this is offset by the fact that the company should perform better with this incentive in place.",

      "question": "Why you would you use PIK (Payment In Kind) debt rather than other types of debt, and how does it affect the debt schedules and the other statements? Unlike “normal” debt, a PIK loan does not require the borrower to make cash interest payments – instead, the interest just accrues to the loan principal, which keeps going up over time. A PIK “toggle” allows the company to choose whether to pay the interest in cash or have it accrue to the principal (these have disappeared since the credit crunch).",
      "model_answer": "PIK is more risky than other forms of debt and carries with it a higher interest rate than traditional bank debt or high yield debt. Adding it to the debt schedules is similar to adding high-yield debt with a bullet maturity – except instead of assuming cash interest payments, you assume that the interest accrues to the principal instead. You should then include this interest on the Income Statement, but you need to add back any PIK interest on the Cash Flow Statement because it’s a non-cash expense.",

      "model_answer": "First, note that you only look at optional repayments for Revolvers and Term Loans – high-yield debt doesn’t have a prepayment option, so effectively it’s always $0. First, you check how much cash flow you have available based on your Beginning Cash Balance, Minimum Cash Balance, Cash Flow Available for Debt Repayment from the Cash Flow Statement, and how much you use to make Mandatory Debt Repayments. Then, if you’ve used your Revolver at all you pay off the maximum amount that you can with the cash flow you have available. Next, for Term Loan A you assume that you pay off the maximum you can, taking into account that you’ve lost any cash flow you used to pay down the Revolver. You also need to take into account that you might have paid off some of Term Loan A’s principal as part of the Mandatory Repayments. Finally, you do the same thing for Term Loan B, subtracting from the “cash flow available for debt repayment” what you’ve already used up on the Revolver and Term Loan A. And just like Term Loan A, you need to take into account any Mandatory Repayments you’ve made so that you don’t pay off more than the entire Term Loan B balance. The formulas here get very messy and depend on how your model is set up, but this is the basic idea for optional debt repayments.",

The formula is: Revolver Borrowing = MAX(0, Total Mandatory Debt Repayment – Cash Flow Available to Repay Debt). The Revolver starts off “undrawn,” meaning that you don’t actually borrow money and don’t accrue a balance unless you need it – similar to how credit cards work. You add any required Revolver Borrowing to your running total for cash flow available for debt repayment before you calculate Mandatory and Optional Debt Repayments. Within the debt repayments themselves, you assume that any Revolver Borrowing from previous years is paid off first with excess cash flow before you pay off any Term Loans.",

Cost Savings and new Depreciation / Amortization hit the Operating Income line; Interest Expense and Sponsor Management Fees hit Pre-Tax Income; and you need to subtract the dividend items from your Net Income number.",
